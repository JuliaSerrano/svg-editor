So the fix will consist in:
- For the mouse version, add the functionality of closing the polygons (different click or some other way).
- In the keyboard mode, maybe just put predifined polygons, and the user may select only the the number of sides (maybe also the size ?).","SERRANO ARRESE, JULIA",200119,"","",No,No,,2024-06-13 15:58:39,2024-06-16 00:48:52,2024-06-16 00:48:52,Sprint 2,,"bug,high,to-do",0,0
